## Hi there üëã

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on data analysis related to communities monitored in respect to generation and consumption of solar energy; (as well) I am working on how to speed up the optimization process of automated synthesis.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about machine learning, software R, optimization with model checking.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on R&D projects related to rural electrification, mainly with international cooperation/funding.
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with vZ and binary search for optimization.
- üí¨ Ask me about rural electrification in the Amazon basin, about automated verification applied to cyberphisical systems, and about automated synthesis applied to solar photovoltaic systems.
- üì´ How to reach me: alessandrotrindade@ufam.edu.br
- ‚ö° Fun fact: ...I like rock music, old ones mainly...
