- ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8262-2919
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on data analysis related to riverside communities monitored in respect to generation and consumption of solar energy; (as well) I am working on how to speed up the optimization process of automated synthesis.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently exploring ML (machine learning) and data analysis with Weka and Orange tools; and deep diving in optimization with model checking.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on R&D projects related to rural electrification and/or formal synthesis/verification of electrical systems, mainly with international cooperation/funding.
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with vZ and binary search for optimization; and the use of ML in health studies and surveyed data from riverside communities.
- üí¨ Ask me about rural electrification in the Amazon basin, about automated verification applied to cyber-physical systems, and about automated synthesis applied to solar photovoltaic systems.
- :pray: Philanthropy and assistance work for the most needy? Yes, I do too. Specially if it is linked to an action coordinated by the Catholic church, as in http://guadalupemanaus.com.br/ and https://pnsnazare.org.br/
