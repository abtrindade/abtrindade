## Hi there 👋

- :mag: CV (resume) in Brazilian academic online format `Lattes` http://lattes.cnpq.br/4511445991061477 
- `ORCID`: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8262-2919
- 🔭 I’m currently working on `data analysis` related to riverside communities monitored in respect to `generation and consumption of solar photovoltaic energy`; (as well) I am working on how to speed up the `optimization` process of `automated synthesis`. Besides the use of ESP8266 NodeMcu in `IoT`
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring `machine learning` (ML) and data analysis with Weka and Orange tools; deep diving in optimization with `model checking`; and the use of IoT with `NodeMCU`
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on `R&D projects` related to rural electrification and/or formal synthesis/verification of electrical systems, mainly with `international cooperation/funding`.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with vZ and binary search for optimization; and the use of ML in health studies and surveyed data from riverside communities.
- 💬 Ask me about rural electrification in the Amazon basin, about automated verification applied to cyber-physical systems, and about automated synthesis applied to solar photovoltaic systems.
- Since NOV/2015 working as Professor of the Electrical Engineering undergraduation course at UFAM (https://eletrotecnicaeng.sites.ufam.edu.br/); and since AUG/2022 as Professor of the Electrical Engineering Graduate Program at UFAM (https://ppgee.ufam.edu.br/)
- :pray: Philanthropy and assistance work for the most needy? Yes, I do too. Specially if it is linked to an action coordinated by the Catholic church, as in http://guadalupemanaus.com.br/ and https://pnsnazare.org.br/
