### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data analysis related to communities monitored in respect to generation and consumption of solar energy; (as well) I am working on how to speed up the optimization process of automated synthesis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about machine learning, software R, optimization with model checking.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R&D projects related to rural electrification, mainly with international cooperation/funding.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with vZ and binary search for optimization.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about rural electrification in the Amazon basin, about automated verification applied to cyberphisical systems, and about automated synthesis applied to solar photovoltaic systems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: alessandrotrindade@ufam.edu.br
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...I like rock music, old ones mainly...
